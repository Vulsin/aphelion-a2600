# Aphelion

`a·phe·li·on (əˈfēlēən): The point in the orbit of a planet, asteroid, or comet at which it is furthest from the sun`

Simple Defender-ish shooter game for Atari 2600. This is a project for me to learn assembly and create a simple video game in the process.

This project requires the DASM assembler to build. Playable binary will be available when I finish this thing.
